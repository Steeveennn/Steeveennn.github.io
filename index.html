        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Steven Trinh. I am a student at California State University, Sacramento
            studying computer science. I'm in my last year here, and I am graduating in May 2024.
            Computer science has always been something that has intrigued me. Ever since I was young,
            whether it was problem-solving or games, solving these things gave me satisfaction that I
            like nothing else could. My favorite hobbies outside of schooling are video games, eating food,
            and hanging out with my friends.
        </p>

        <h3>Favorite Video Game</h3>

        <p>
            My favorite video game is <a href="https://playvalorant.com/">Valorant.</a>

        <h3>Favorite Food</h3>

        <p>
            My favorite food is Steak with an Asian "crack" sauce. Occasionally, I will tend to go back to the classic
            steak with A1 sauce. However, ever since I was introduced to the savory and spicy aspect that "crack" sauce
            provides to steak, I cannot go back.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Favorite Activity</h3>

        <p>
            When I am not playing video games, eating food, or working on school work, you can find me playing basketball
            with my friends. Usually when I am playing basketball, it is typically outside at the park. However, when the
            weather is not suitable for outdoor basketball, my friends get everyone in with their guest passes at the gym.
